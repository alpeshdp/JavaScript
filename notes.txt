# How to add a data to request, so that view can render it?
#* server.xml
1. 
Message.findOne().exec(function(err, doc) {
    console.log(doc);
    if(err) {
        messageResult = 'No Message Found from Mongo';
    } else {
        messageResult = doc.message;
    }
    console.log("MessageResult is:" + messageResult)
});

2.
app.get('*', function(req, res) {
    res.render('index', {
        MonGoMessage : messageResult
    });
});

#* index.jade
h2=MonGoMessage

What's New? (Level1)
1. Views (partials) organized in different folders on server side
2. Added content to main page
3. Explained recursive loop betwen Express and Angular
   Check server.js 
   -- get for partials will not match hence * will render index.jade
   -- index.jade will request for partial .... infinite loop 
4. Login UI added.   

   
What's New? (Level-2)
1. Moved partials from server to client, so that angular controllers are grouped better.
2. No need to maintain parallel directories in client and server.

What's New? (Level-3)
module.exports
 -- Export public functions using require(path...)
 -- It can be a function or an object.
 
 
What's New? (Level-4)
Added server side code to authenticate user with passport-local strategy. 
Hooked up client with server
Refactored client code:
-- Added service to authenticate, notify and hold user (identity)
-- Login controller handles  just display logic.
